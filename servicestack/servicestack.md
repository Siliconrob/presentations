- **Runs** anywhere :runner:
- Works with your choice of **language+framework** :nut_and_bolt:
	- **Polyglots** welcome!
- [Documentation](https://docs.servicestack.net/)
- **Mature and supported**: **10+** years of development history
- **Growing** year over year and Demis is **always** on top of the hard code paths first for you

# Inspiration

- Be **productive**
- Value **composition** over **inheritance**
- Work with **Web** standards
- **Consistency**
- [Pipelines](https://docs.servicestack.net/order-of-operations)

# Guiding Principles
- **Simplicity**: :one: + :one: = :two:
- **Performance** as feature :rocket:
- **Lightweight**: code first focus 🏋️
- **Testability**: Unit, Integration, Application 🧪
- **Message** based architecture: Coming back to this later :arrows_counterclockwise:

### Release Notes
https://docs.servicestack.net/release-notes-history

# Messaging

- **Every input** request DTO has a **corresponding response** DTO

## Request/Response
- Any DTO object -> serialized to Response ContentType
- HttpResult, HttpError, CompressedResult (IHttpResult) for Customized HTTP response

---

# Messaging Example

```

```


---


# Core Components

- **ServiceStack.Text**: **Free** from restrictions on use
- **ServiceStack.OrmLite**: **Dapper++**
- **ServiceStack.Redis**
- **ServiceStack.Caching**
- And many, many more are [available](https://servicestack.net/download)

# Helpful Tips

- Assemblies are **units of deployment NOT** logical boundaries
- Keep your model assembly small and dependency free
- Message DTOs **should** only contain serializable fields **NOT** behavior
- Extension methods are your **friends**
- Pipelining behavior in a Fluent functional manner is **good**
- Remember that HTTP is underlying

# Routing

## Explicit

1. Any exact Literal Matches are used first
2. Exact Verb match is preferred over All Verbs
3. The more variables in your route the less weighting it has
4. Routes with wildcard variables have the lowest precedence
5. When Routes have the same weight, the order is determined by the position of the Action in the service or Order of Registration (FIFO)
