# What is it?

---
* Lightweight JavaScript geospatial library
* Created by [Morgan Herlocker](https://twitter.com/morganherlocker)
* Open Source - MIT License
* Complete engine vailable as
	- NPM module - ```npm install @turf/turf```
    - Live link - ```https://npmcdn.com/@turf/turf/turf.min.js```
* Customizable build options available  
* Majority of operations work with [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/)

---
### Simple

* The majority of functions are GeoJSON input/output -- Add more here

---
# Walkthrough

GeoJSON constructors
* Point
* Line
* Polygon
* Feature Collection

---
# Common Functions
* Aggregation - Explain, example
* Measurement - Explain, example
* Transformation - Explain, example
* Data methods - Explain, example
* Interpolation - Explain, example
* Join - Explain, example
* Classification - Explain, example

---
### Fast

* Local processed, client or server
* Speed test results

---

### Modular

* Example of single component build piece say random

---
# How do I use it?

---
# Example 1

==random(type, count, options)==
```
const points = turf.random('points', 2, { bbox: [-122.3401, 47.5993, -122.3089, 47.6163] });
```

Results

```
{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.33333206790134,47.61235696404421]},"properties":{}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.32510703154492,47.60679435175362]},"properties":{}}]}
